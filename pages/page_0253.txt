115 In 1961, two American squadrons 865 and 866 with 15 medium-range PGM-19 "Jupiter" missiles each were deployed in Southern Italy in Bari province, and squadron 867 (15 missiles) in Turkey near Izmir. The deployment of missiles in Turkey caused serious concern in the USSR due to very short preparation time for launch and proximity to main targets in European USSR territory. Following the Caribbean Crisis (see note 63) and in accordance with agreements from late 1962, dismantling and withdrawal of missiles from Turkey began, followed by Italy, which was completed in April 1963 and mid-1963 respectively. "Jupiter" missiles were removed from service and utilized in connection with putting UGM-27 "Polaris" missiles on combat duty.

The stewardesses organized a snack, opened a bottle of red wine, prepared a bouquet of flowers in advance. When everything was ready, they asked one of them to go to Mikoyan's salon and say that the assistants request him to come out. The flight attendant protested:

"How can I disturb Mikoyan?"

"Go, if anything we'll cover for you," the assistants assured her.
