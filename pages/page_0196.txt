Oswald acted alone and was not connected to any conspiratorial forces in the USA or beyond.

Third. Explaining the circumstances of Oswald's own murder by Jack Ruby, McCloy noted that Ruby's actions, as evidenced by undisputed facts, "were in no way connected to an attempt to 'cover up traces' of the president's murder." According to the interlocutor, Ruby's actions were "entirely due to his personal adventurism, which was characteristic of Ruby, who had spent his whole life associated with people of low reputation and dishonest activities."

Responding to my question about whether the commission has reliable testimony from Oswald himself, McCloy regretfully noted that "Oswald's testimony was not recorded on tape, and we had to rely on investigators' testimony and their evidence." Oswald himself, McCloy noted, "denied his guilt in Kennedy's murder or other persons' until his last minute."

Fourth. Regarding Marina Oswald's role, McCloy said that "Marina confirmed Oswald's completed attempt on General Walker and the planned attempt on Nixon. She also expressed conviction that Kennedy's killer was indeed Oswald." McCloy emphasized several times that Marina Oswald "is not naive at all, and her testimony has substantial significance."

Fifth. To my comment about inconsistencies in the testimony of Oswald's wife and mother, based on press reports, McCloy said that the statements and behavior of Oswald's mother cause deep distress to the commission. Oswald's mother, McCloy added, is largely responsible for how her son developed. She abandoned him too early, showing irresponsibility, and recently showed cynicism toward her son. Suffice it to say, McCloy continued, that Oswald's mother, after sending a letter to President Johnson and receiving no response, declared that she was outraged by such presidential behavior: "Johnson owes everything to my son. He would have remained nothing if not for my son." According to McCloy, Oswald's mother demands recognition of her special role in connection with the Dallas tragedy, insisting that she should be "properly rewarded and appreciated, as befits cases when people gain great notoriety." McCloy added that it is unpleasant for him to speak about Oswald's mother since she "reduces everything to litigation and acquiring material benefits from what happened in Dallas." To my question about how to explain such firm behavior of Oswald's mother and her statements contradicting the official version of Oswald's guilt, the interlocutor said that to some extent her behavior is conditioned by the fact that on the eve of Oswald's murder, she had a meeting with him in the police jail, where "Oswald convinced her of his complete innocence."

Sixth. In conclusion, McCloy said that he is aware of Soviet people's views on the Dallas tragedy, who see a certain conspiracy in Kennedy's murder
