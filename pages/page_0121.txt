Transmitting text of Johnson's message to N.S. Khrushchev

"The White House,
Washington.
November 26, 1963.
Dear Mr. Chairman,

In addition to the public message which I sent you, I wanted you to know that I have been following closely the development of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union and that I fully agreed with President Kennedy's policy. I hope that we can achieve success in improving our relations and in resolving many serious problems that face us.

Allow me to say that I fully realize the grave responsibility that our two countries bear for preserving and strengthening peace. I hope that we can work together to achieve this great goal, despite the many and complex problems that divide us. I can assure you that I will dedicate myself to this goal.

Sincerely yours,
Lyndon B. Johnson
To His Excellency Nikita S. Khrushchev
Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Moscow."
