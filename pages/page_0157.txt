I think that in the coming years, under the leadership role of the Chairman and President Johnson, we will be able to achieve this result.

Thank you again
R. Kennedy

TASS Report "Statement by U.S. State Department Representative"

December 1, 1963

TP.OV.0630. NEW YORK, December 1 (TASS). Associated Press Agency transmits the following message from Washington, dated November 30:

The State Department representative announced this evening that Soviet Ambassador Anatoly F. Dobrynin delivered today, in the second half of the day, to Secretary of State Dean Rusk the Soviet consulate's dossier on Lee Harvey Oswald, who is accused of President Kennedy's murder.

The State Department immediately transferred these documents, written in Russian, to the FBI for use in the investigation.

Until the FBI familiarizes itself with these documents, it is difficult to say whether they contain any new or important information for the ongoing investigation of Kennedy's murder.

State Department Press Officer Richard Phillips stated that the United States had not requested the Soviet Union to provide them with their consulate's dossier on Oswald.

The fact that Dobrynin delivered this dossier to Rusk at the State Department today apparently testified to a desire to amicably assist American authorities in their initiated investigation. Soviet Premier Minister Khrushchev condemned Kennedy's assassination. Moscow press hinted that it was inspired by right-wing forces.
