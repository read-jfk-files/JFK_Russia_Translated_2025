"The Commission did not establish any direct or indirect connection between Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby," states the report. "It also could not find any credible evidence that they knew each other, although a thorough investigation was conducted into numerous rumors and suggestions about connections between them. There is also no evidence that Ruby and Officer Tippit knew each other, or that Oswald and Tippit knew each other.

Ruby was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to death for the murder of Oswald. He appealed the verdict.

The Commission deeply examined Oswald's motives that led to his terrible crime, without finding, however, an exhaustive answer. The Commission expressed the following consideration on this matter:

"The motives that drove Oswald to murder were undoubtedly based on many factors, and the commission does not consider it possible to attribute to him any single motive or group of motives. It is evident, however, that the motivation that guided Oswald was largely conditioned by his hostile attitude toward the surrounding environment. He evidently was unable to establish reasonable relationships with other people. He was in a state of constant dissatisfaction with the surrounding world."

"Long before the murder, he expressed hatred toward American society and actively demonstrated his protest. Oswald's aspiration toward what he considered an ideal society was doomed to failure from the very beginning. He wanted to secure a place in history, to play the role of a 'great man' who would gain universal recognition as a person ahead of his time. His adherence to Marxism and communism was, apparently, also an important factor in his motivation. He had also previously proved his ability to act decisively, regardless of consequences, when such action facilitated achieving his goal at that moment." All these factors and many others, based on which Lee Harvey Oswald's character developed, created a person capable of killing President Kennedy.

Regarding Officer Tippit's murder, the report states that two witnesses were eyewitnesses to the murder, and seven witnesses heard the shots and saw how the shooter fled the crime scene.

All nine "positively identified" Lee Oswald as this person. The bullets found at the scene of the policeman's murder were fired from a revolver that was in Oswald's possession during his arrest. The revolver found on him was purchased by Oswald and belonged to him. Along the escape route of the person who shot and killed the policeman, Oswald's jacket was found.

Regarding the questioning of Oswald and his detention in jail, the commission states that he was not subjected to any physical impact by police representatives. He was informed that they could not force him to give testimony, and that
