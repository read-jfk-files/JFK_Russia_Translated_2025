Signal Copy

What is lacking today? What is lacking is the desire of Western powers to reach an agreement and abandon playing at negotiations*.

As for the Soviet Union, we are ready to sign an agreement on the cessation of all nuclear tests today. The ball is in the West's court. We agreed to a meeting of representatives of three powers in Moscow to try once again to negotiate on this issue. But the success of this meeting will depend on what baggage the representatives of the USA and England bring to our country.

The President of the United States addresses such a crucial modern problem as universal and complete disarmament. He is right when he says that this is not a simple or easy problem, and its solution will require considerable effort and certain time.

The Soviet government continues to spare no effort in considering disarmament issues. State leaders must finally realize their great responsibility to humanity for solving such an urgent task as ending the arms race.

President Kennedy suggests that it would be good to direct the resources freed from the arms race to more noble purposes. There is indeed still much poverty, hunger and unemployment in the world. It would be good if the United States government's concrete actions followed these good wishes about disarmament.

The Soviet government's proposals on this matter are widely known.

To improve the international situation and relations between states, along with the mentioned issues, the expansion of economic ties and development of trade is of great importance.

The President of the United States, unfortunately, says nothing about this in his speech.

The United States government practically prohibits trade with the Soviet Union‚Å∑. True, the ban on importing crabs from the Soviet Union to the USA was lifted. Crabs are indeed a tasty thing. However, one cannot go far on crabs alone.

The Soviet Union is a large country. We possess all necessary resources for developing industry and agriculture. We manage without trade with the United States of America and, apparently, will continue to successfully develop our economy without trading with them in the future. I speak about developing trade between the Soviet Union and the USA because trade is an indicator of good relations between countries.

The United States of America not only refuses to trade with us themselves but also pressures their allies, often prohibiting them from trading with the Soviet Union. The most striking example of such pressure is that the USA forced West German firms to violate contractual obligations and not supply steel pipes to the Soviet Union.

*The word "agreement" was replaced with "negotiations".
