with sound mental health. His intention to remain in the USSR is unwavering and, if he is again denied asylum, he may repeat his suicide attempt.

After being discharged from the hospital on October 29, OSWALD was again received by the head of OVIR and repeated his request for the right of residence in the USSR.

On November 11, 1959, the deputy chairman of "Inturist" BOICHENKO sent a memo about everything that happened with OSWALD to A.I. MIKOYAN, who instructed comrade SEMENOV (MFA USSR) and comrade SHELEPIN (KGB under CM USSR) to "examine and submit their proposals to the CC CPSU."

In a note from MFA and KGB to the CC CPSU dated November 27, it was stated: "Considering that some foreigners previously granted Soviet citizenship (SITRINEL, AVISHA204), after living for some time in the USSR, left our country, and also taking into account that OSWALD has not yet been sufficiently studied, it is advisable to grant him the right of temporary residence in the USSR for one year, providing him with work and housing. In this case, the question of OSWALD's permanent residence in the Soviet Union and his acceptance into Soviet citizenship could be decided after this period expires"205.

The CC CPSU agreed with this opinion206, and on December 1, 1959, by decree No. 3363-rs, the Council of Ministers of the USSR decided to "grant US citizen Lee Harvey OSWALD, who applied for Soviet citizenship, the right of temporary residence in the Soviet Union for one year, with the question of his permanent residence in the USSR and acceptance into Soviet citizenship to be decided after this period expires."

The Executive Committee of the Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the USSR was instructed to assign OSWALD a monthly allowance of 700 rubles and allocate 5,000 rubles for apartment furnishing.

In early January 1960, OSWALD arrived in Minsk and was temporarily housed in a hotel. The Council of National Economy directed him, with his consent, to the radio engineering factory, considering that, as OSWALD stated, he had studied radio engineering during his military service in the USA. Since in January the City Council could not provide him with an apartment near the factory, with the American's consent, it was decided that he would receive an apartment after some time in a building that was nearing completion.

According to available materials, all conditions were created at the factory for OSWALD to master the work. A good specialist was assigned to mentor him.

OSWALD during his stay in Moscow and the initial period of residence in Minsk generally behaved loyally toward Soviet reality and expressed no dissatisfaction with the conditions in which he was placed.

In April 1961, OSWALD married twenty-year-old M.N. PRUSAKOVA, an assistant pharmacist at the 3rd Clinical Hospital of Minsk. PRUSAKOVA was born in North-
