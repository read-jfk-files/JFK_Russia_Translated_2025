The stated position of the US government regarding non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the creation of unified NATO nuclear forces with West Germany's participation was confirmed by President Kennedy in conversation with Comrade Gromyko on October 10 of this year. Under these conditions, achieving any progress in negotiations on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons has proven impossible so far.

Representatives of the USA and, especially, England showed heightened interest during discussions regarding measures to prevent sudden attack. Discussion of this issue revealed that Western powers seek to gain unilateral advantages by pursuing the placement of control posts on territories of Warsaw Pact and NATO countries without connection to disarmament measures and improving the situation in Europe. As the only measure they expressed willingness to combine with establishing control posts, they named advance mutual notification between parties about major troop movements in Europe.

From our side, it was stated that the Soviet Union has a positive attitude toward adopting measures to prevent sudden attack, including establishing control posts in territories of countries belonging to the two opposing state groupings. However, control posts can be beneficial if their establishment is accompanied by specific practical steps aimed at easing international tension - reduction of foreign troops in European countries and refusal to place nuclear weapons on the territory of the two German states. Comrade Gromyko especially emphasized that without implementing these measures, placement of control posts would not only bring no benefit but would even intensify the current suspicion in relations between states.

Regarding the reduction of foreign troops in Europe, Rusk stated that he does not deny the importance of this problem, but without linking it to the issue of control posts. He claimed that the USA has already started taking some practical steps regarding reduction of their troops in Europe. Kennedy indicated in the October 10 conversation that the USA considers it more appropriate not to achieve any formal agreement on reducing foreign troops in Europe, but rather implementation of unilateral actions by parties in this direction. He said that the USA does not intend to increase their troop numbers in West Germany, and in a year these troops will even be reduced.

Rusk and Home spoke in favor of having the issue of control posts further examined in the Committee of 18. From our side, no objections were raised against this proposal, but it was indicated that the issue of control posts should be considered in conjunction with reduction of foreign troops in Europe and refusal to place nuclear weapons in FRG and GDR.
