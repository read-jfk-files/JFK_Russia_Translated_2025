US news agency reported at 16:00 that Dallas police, Texas arrested American citizen Lee H. Oswald, 24 years old, chairman of the local branch of Fair Play for Cuba Committee, on suspicion of Kennedy's murder.

It is also reported that Oswald had previously been in the USSR and is married to a Russian woman.

Verification through the embassy's consular section established that indeed Oswald lived in Minsk for several years, where he married Soviet citizen Marina Nikolaevna Prusakova, born 1941.

In June 1962, they returned to the USA. In March 1963, Prusakova petitioned to return with her daughter to the USSR for permanent residence.

USSR MFA Consular Department (letter No. KU-USA-540058-24518 dated October 7, 1963) reported that her petition was denied.

The embassy's consular section has correspondence with Prusakova and Lee Oswald regarding her return to the USSR. The last letter from Lee Oswald was dated November 9 (text transmitted through close neighbors).

It is possible that American authorities may request to review the correspondence in our possession.
