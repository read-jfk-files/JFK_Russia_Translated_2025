official and complete investigation of events.

Here, briefly, are the contents of the twelve conclusions reached by the commission and listed in the report:

1. The shots that killed President Kennedy and wounded Texas Governor John Connally were fired from a sixth-floor window at the southeast corner of the building, which housed a school book depository.

2. The totality of evidence indicates that three shots were fired. One of the shots missed its target, but the commission is not certain which shot it was.

3. There is convincing evidence presented by experts indicating that the same bullet that penetrated the President's neck also caused wounds to Governor Connally. This was the first of two bullets that hit the President.

4. The shots that killed President Kennedy and wounded Governor Connally were fired by Lee Harvey Oswald.

5. Oswald killed Dallas police officer J.D. Tippit approximately forty-five minutes after the President's assassination.

6. Eighty minutes after the President's assassination, and thirty-five minutes after Tippit's murder, Oswald resisted arrest in a Dallas movie theater, attempting to shoot another Dallas police officer.

7. Oswald was not subjected to physical violence by the police, although force was necessary to arrest him. He was subjected to "hostile attacks" due to "unrestricted access" granted to local journalists through which he had to pass during his transfer from the jail cell to another part of the building. Numerous statements, "sometimes erroneous," by police officers after his arrest would have presented "serious obstacles" to ensuring a fair trial for Oswald.

8. Jack Ruby killed Lee Harvey Oswald. There is no evidence indicating that any police officer assisted him in this. However, the Dallas police made a mistake by attempting to transfer Oswald to another prison "in full public view."

9. The commission found no evidence indicating that Lee Harvey Oswald or Jack Ruby were part of any conspiracy, domestic or foreign, to assassinate President Kennedy. Furthermore, the commission found no evidence indicating that any foreign government hired Oswald, persuaded or encouraged him, the report states.

10. Throughout the investigation, the commission found no evidence that would indicate a conspiracy, subversive activity, or disloyalty toward the United States government by any federal, state, or local officials.
