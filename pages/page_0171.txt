TO CPSU CENTRAL COMMITTEE

In conversation with USSR Ambassador A.F. Dobrynin, US State Secretary D. Rusk requested to communicate, if possible, the reasons for refusing to grant Soviet citizenship to American citizen Oswald (telegram from Washington No. 2054207).

The USSR Ministry of Foreign Affairs and KGB under the USSR Council of Ministers consider it expedient to instruct the Soviet Ambassador to verbally inform Rusk that American citizen Oswald did not meet the criteria sufficient for satisfying his request for Soviet citizenship.
