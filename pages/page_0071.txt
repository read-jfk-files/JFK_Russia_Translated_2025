creation of NATO's unified nuclear forces, while the USA insists that nuclear weapons should not appear "in national hands" of other states.

In this regard, Mr. Gromyko strongly criticized the plans to create NATO's unified nuclear forces, aimed at providing actual access to nuclear weapons to West German revanchists with all the dangerous consequences for peace that would follow. The Soviet side also clearly indicated that these US plans currently represent the main obstacle to reaching an agreement on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.

US representatives, while expressing willingness to negotiate non-proliferation of nuclear weapons only on the previously proposed American basis, which does not exclude the creation of NATO's unified nuclear forces with West Germany's participation, tried to dispute our criticism of the plans to create these forces. Kennedy and Rusk stated that the USA does not intend to provide nuclear weapons to other states under any circumstances, including West Germany. The plans for creating multilateral NATO nuclear forces, according to them, are not yet finalized, but under all circumstances these plans will not involve transfer of American nuclear weapons to other states, and neither the West German government nor any other non-nuclear NATO state will be able to order their military to deploy these weapons. In NATO's unified nuclear forces, according to Kennedy and Rusk's statements, no actual involvement of West Germany with nuclear weapons would supposedly occur.

The American side also stated that the USA fears West Germany might follow France's path and begin creating nuclear weapons on a national basis. Kennedy and Rusk tried to present the matter as if the creation of NATO's unified nuclear forces is conceived primarily to bind West Germany in this regard. They also claimed that concluding a non-proliferation agreement would serve as an important additional "insurance" in this sense, as this agreement would prevent West Germany from attempting to transition from participation in NATO's unified nuclear forces to possessing nuclear weapons on a national basis.

All these arguments were, of course, rejected from our side.

With a view to increase pressure on the US government, Mr. Gromyko posed a question to American leadership whether it would be possible to agree that the plan for creating NATO's unified nuclear forces would not be actually implemented. He indicated that such an agreement would facilitate reaching an agreement on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Americans responded to this question indicating that the USA would not agree to abandon the plan for creating NATO's multilateral nuclear forces.
