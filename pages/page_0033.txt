It did not cause us any damage, but those who gave in to pressure lost out. As they say, another cold gust has been added to the winds of the Cold War.

Look at how the American press reacts to the presence of the Soviet foreign trade workers' delegation in the USA*. It accuses this delegation of virtually anti-American activities* because the Soviet delegation seeks to establish contacts with business people to develop normal Soviet-American trade relations. If such activity is condemned in the USA as "impermissible"**, then what remains of the words in favor of improving Soviet-American relations and ending the Cold War?

Question. From the President's speech, it is clear that he acknowledges the inevitability and necessity of coexistence of states with different social systems. At the same time, his speech repeats the usual assertions of Western propaganda that communists are trying to impose their system on other countries and that this is supposedly the main cause of international tension.

What can be said about such statements by the US President?

Answer. In this case, the US President, unfortunately, uses Dulles' vocabulary, who spoke many harsh words about communism. Capitalist orders are crumbling and cracking due to objective laws of historical development. And the President tries to explain this by "attempts of communists to impose their political and economic system on others." The foundations of capitalism are not crumbling from harsh words, but due to irreconcilable contradictions between labor and capital, as a result of peoples' struggle for their freedom.

As is known, while advocating for peaceful coexistence of states with different social systems, we do not propose coexistence in the realm of ideologies, but we are also not supporters of resolving ideological disputes through war between states. This is our point of view, this is our policy.

In conclusion, I would like to say that overall, US President Kennedy's speech makes a positive impression. We welcome with satisfaction the call for improving relations between the United States of America and the Soviet Union, his statement "let's reconsider our attitude toward the Soviet Union." We agree with the President's statement that the peoples of our countries are mutually interested in preserving peace. The peoples of the Soviet Union respect the talented and hardworking people of the United States of America and want to have friendlier relations with them.

We are deeply convinced that the US President's call for improving relations between countries and ending the "Cold War," for improving relations between the peoples of the Soviet Union and the USA will be supported by absolute
