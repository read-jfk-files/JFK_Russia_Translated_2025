in private conversations with many officials regarding Castro. This, Reston said, personally greatly concerns him from the perspective of unpredictable international consequences if Cuba somehow becomes implicated in the Oswald case.

Reston emphasized that Johnson and, especially, Rusk clearly understand the potential danger of such complications, and they have quietly taken several measures to avoid inflaming passions and not give any additional reasons for speculation from their side. Johnson's creation of a commission headed by the Chief Justice Warren reflects American leaders' desire to concentrate the entire Oswald case in one place and prevent various conjectures and fabrications that only damage USA's international prestige.

Reston also reported that investigators have evidence that Oswald knew Ruby, who later killed him, and that they maintained contact. It is still unclear whether Oswald himself was somehow involved with the criminal world that Ruby was connected to, or if there were other reasons. Some people close to Ruby speak about Oswald's attempt to blackmail Ruby for some reason with the aim of obtaining money or holding some money. The FBI is currently investigating these matters.

Reston, who has long known Johnson well, said that Johnson will undoubtedly seek reelection in 1964. Reston characterized him as a person with a strong character, very self-loving, but extremely cautious in politics. He likes informal communication, various anecdotes and sometimes not quite censored stories common among Western cowboys. He is interested in and understands cattle breeding; prize cattle are raised at his ranch. He avoids "theorists" and "philosophers" and generally "overly" educated people, who are called "eggheads" here. Less flexible than Kennedy. Prefers to discuss specific questions and concrete matters, without wasting time on too lengthy planning or detailed analysis of various aspects. He is proud of his poor origins and likes to recall this, emphasizing that he came from the people. Knows how and likes to drink properly.

Reston believes that until the elections Johnson will conduct Kennedy's foreign and domestic policy almost unchanged (paying more attention to the latter), as Johnson is convinced that such a course gives him the best chances for reelection. With his flair and ability to navigate political moods within the USA, Johnson, Reston noted, has long been well-known among his former colleagues - senators and leaders of both parties.

During the conversation, Reston noted that as far as he could judge, Johnson is positively disposed toward meeting with N.S. Khrushchev during the next year and that in his, Reston's, opinion such a meeting could take place in late spring or early
