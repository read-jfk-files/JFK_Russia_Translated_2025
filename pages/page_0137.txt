governments understand what nuclear war means in modern conditions and therefore understand that it cannot be allowed. However, West Germany has territorial claims against the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland¹⁶⁹. True, its government states that it wants to resolve this issue peacefully.

But it is clear that the borders established after World War II can only be changed by force. Discussions about this are playing with fire. That is why we oppose West Germany gaining control over nuclear weapons. We are not at all afraid if NATO's nuclear forces increase, as we have more than enough power to destroy Germany in one day if war breaks out. The main thing is to prevent nuclear weapons from being transferred to supporters of aggression.

We especially don't understand why this needs to be done now, when there is no direct threat of war and when international tensions have even decreased. We don't understand why under these conditions you seek to aggravate the international situation.

As for further discussion of this issue, this could be done after your consultations with allies, which, as you say, will take place in December.

Rusk expressed hope that discussion of this issue would continue, and added that it is not as difficult as we imagine it to be.

At this point Rusk asked to end the conversation, as he was suddenly called by telephone to President Johnson, who had scheduled a meeting with a group of ambassadors that Rusk had to attend.

Apologizing, Rusk suggested continuing, if I wanted, the conversation without him - with his colleagues who were present at the meeting.

I said there was no need for this.

Present at the meeting from the American side were Harriman, Thompson, Davis and Akalovsky; from the Soviet side - Dobrynin, Smirnovsky and Sukhodrev.
