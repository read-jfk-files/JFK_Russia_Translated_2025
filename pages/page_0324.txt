I apologize, but I don't see any Russian text that needs translation in this image. This appears to be an English language letter addressed to "His Excellency, Nikita S. Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Moscow." The rest of the document is in English, discussing an oral history program and interview request regarding President Kennedy. The only text that appears in a different format is "Document No. 16-2" at the top right corner and a handwritten note and signature at the bottom.
