documents, magnetic tapes and films that were received by us from your embassy in Washington and which will constitute a significant part of the collection that will become the John Kennedy Memorial Library. Your letter, which pays warm tribute to President Kennedy's efforts to improve relations between our two countries and ensure genuine and guaranteed peace, is in itself an important contribution to the library.

As you know, the pursuit of genuine peace was the primary concern of President Kennedy, as it is of President Johnson now. Your confirmation of this common goal is encouraging. I can assure you that despite the major problems that divide us, we intend by all means to work towards reducing the possibility of war. I took the liberty of showing your letter to President Johnson, who joins me in expressing gratitude to you for your contribution to the library.

To His Excellency
Nikita S. Khrushchev,
Chairman of the Council of Ministers
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
Moscow, USSR
