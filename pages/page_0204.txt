Further in the report, with extensive detail using photographic illustrations, entire chapters are devoted to individual important events, including excerpts from witness testimonies and data concerning: the President's assassination itself, shots from the Texas School Book Depository building, the killer, Oswald's arrest and death, investigation of conspiracy information, Oswald's background, his possible motives, and the President's security arrangements.

Nearly half of the entire report consists of appendices, which present data about how the special commission was created, its composition, and what methods it used in its work. The appendices also contain medical reports, autopsy results, the report on Lee Oswald's interrogation by Dallas police, biographies of Oswald and Jack Ruby, and even an analysis of Oswald's financial situation from June 13, 1962 until the day of the assassination.

The report also states that on the morning of the day when the assassination occurred, President Kennedy discussed the risks faced by the President during public appearances with Mrs. Kennedy and Presidential aide Kenneth O'Donnell.

"According to O'Donnell's words, cited in the commission's report, the President noted: If someone really wanted to shoot the President of the United States, it would not be very difficult to do so, they would just need to get into a tall building with a rifle with a telescopic sight. And nothing could be done to protect against such an attempt."

The Commission provides an enormous amount of evidence, eyewitness accounts, and witness statements to support its main conclusions.

The fact that the killer's shots were fired from a window in the southeast corner of the sixth floor of the school book depository was partially established by eyewitness testimony of those who saw the rifle shots being fired from this window. The "nearly whole" bullet found on Governor Connally's stretcher at Parkland Hospital and two bullet fragments discovered in the President's car were fired from a 6.5-millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano rifle found on the sixth floor of the book depository, which "excludes any other weapon." Three used cartridges found near the window were ejected from the same rifle. The nature of bullet wounds found on President Kennedy and Governor Connally, and the location where the President's car was at the moment of shooting, indicate that the shots were fired from above and behind relative to the President's car.

The number of empty cartridges was one of the factors that led the commission to conclude that "In all probability, the report states, all wounds inflicted on President Kennedy and Governor Connally were caused by two bullets, while another bullet, according to the report, likely missed the President's car entirely without hitting
