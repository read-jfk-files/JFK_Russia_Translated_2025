ratification and could face difficulties passing through the Senate, but through the implementation of separate arms limitation measures by both sides in a unilateral manner, in parallel, so to speak, "looking at each other."

When considering individual measures aimed at easing international tensions, as is known, an agreement was reached on renouncing the deployment of nuclear weapons in orbit aboard space objects. This agreement, formalized by a unanimously adopted resolution of the UN General Assembly77, which welcomes the intention of the USA and USSR "not to place in outer space any objects carrying nuclear weapons or other types of weapons of mass destruction," has, we believe, positive significance. It represents a real step toward preventing the spread of nuclear arms race into outer space.

During the exchange of views on the issue of a non-aggression pact between NATO and Warsaw Treaty countries, our efforts were directed at consolidating the certain readiness to find a mutually acceptable solution to this issue, shown by US and British representatives during talks in Moscow in July-August of this year, and to try to move further toward reaching a specific agreement.

This approach was also rejected by Comrade Gromyko, as it contradicts the agreed position of socialist countries by limiting our freedom of action regarding the peace treaty with the GDR.

At the same time, President Kennedy was told that the Soviet government has consistently opposed and opposes the use of force in resolving all disputed issues, including issues related to the German peace settlement and normalization based on it of the situation in West Berlin, and that the USSR could
