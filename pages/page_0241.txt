Speaking of other countries, I want to bring clarity to one issue. We are bound by alliances with many countries. These alliances exist because our tasks and their tasks are significantly intertwined. Our obligation to protect Western Europe and West Berlin, for example, remains unchanged due to the identity of our vital interests. The United States will not make any deals with the Soviet Union at the expense of other nations not only because they are our partners, but because their interests and our interests coincide.

Our interests, however, coincide not only where it concerns protecting the borders of freedom, but also where it concerns the search for paths leading to peace. We hope - and such is the goal of our allies - to convince the Soviet Union that it too should allow each country to independently choose its future, if this choice does not interfere with the choices of others. The attempt of communism to impose its political and economic system on others is today the main cause of international tension. There can be no doubt that if countries can refrain from interfering in the self-determination of other countries, peace will be much more reliably secured.

This will require new conditions for creating a world order - a new context for international discussions. This requires greater mutual understanding between the USSR and our country, and greater mutual understanding will require more contacts and connections.

One of the steps in this direction is the proposed agreement on establishing a direct link between Moscow and Washington with the aim of preventing each side from dangerous delays, misunderstandings and misinterpretations of the other side's actions that may occur during a crisis.

We are talking in Geneva about other first-step measures, measures to control weapons, designed to limit the arms race intensity and reduce the risk of accidental war. However, in Geneva our main, long-term goal is achieving universal and complete disarmament, which should proceed in stages, parallel to implementing political measures to create new institutions of peace that would take the place of weapons. The efforts of our government toward disarmament have been directed since the 1920s.

The last three governments have persistently sought disarmament, and no matter how unclear the prospects may be today, we intend to continue our efforts - continue so that all countries, including our own country, could better understand what the real problems and real possibilities are in the field of disarmament.

The single important area of these negotiations where an end is already in sight - but where a new beginning is still acutely needed - is the treaty on banning nuclear tests. Concluding such a treaty is so close and at the same time so far away - it would stop the rapidly developing arms race in one of the most dangerous areas. This treaty would put nuclear powers in such a position where they could more successfully deal with one of the most terrible threats facing humanity - the further spread of nuclear weapons. This would strengthen our security, it would reduce the possibility of war. This goal is certainly important enough to demand our tireless efforts. At the same time, we must not succumb to the temptation to abandon all efforts, the temptation to give up our vitally important guarantees.

Therefore, I want to use this opportunity presented to me and announce two important decisions made at this meeting:

Firstly, Chairman Khrushchev, Prime Minister Macmillan and I have agreed to hold high-level negotiations in Moscow in the near future with the aim of reaching the quickest possible agreement on a comprehensive treaty banning nuclear tests. Given historical experience, we should not indulge in too much hope, but all our hopes are the hopes of all humanity.

Secondly, in order to demonstrate our good intentions and serious confidence in this matter, I declare that the United States does not intend to conduct nuclear tests in the atmosphere, and other countries will not conduct them either. We will not resume such tests first. Such a statement is not a substitute for a formal binding treaty, but I hope it will help us achieve such a treaty. Moreover, such a treaty cannot serve as a substitute for disarmament, but I hope it will help us achieve disarmament.

And in conclusion, my fellow Americans, let us review our position on issues of peace and freedom here, within the country.
