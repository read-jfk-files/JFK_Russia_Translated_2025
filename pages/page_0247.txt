The first organization called Pathet Lao was the United National Front of Laos (Neo Lao Itsala), formed in 1950 to fight against French colonizers. In 1956, on the base of Neo Lao Itsala, the Patriotic Front of Laos (PFL, Lao Haksat) was created. Pathet Lao forces became one of the sides in the civil war in Laos (1960-1973), conducting military operations against the royal Laos army. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam had a strong influence on the organization, arming and supporting the organization. Since 1968, the DRV army largely replaced Pathet Lao forces. After the war ended in 1973, the PFL entered the coalition government. In 1975, Pathet Lao forces carried out an armed coup, taking power into their hands.
