AMERICAN EMBASSY Moscow

Dear Mr. Gromyko,

I consider it my sad duty to inform you of the death of President of the United States of America John Fitzgerald Kennedy, which occurred on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. I would also like to inform you that Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as President of the United States of America at 15:39 on November 22, 1963, Eastern time⁸⁷.

In accordance with our national customs, the Embassy will observe mourning for 30 days.

A book of condolences will be open at my residence on November 23, 24, and 25 between 12:00 and 13:00 and 15:00 and 17:00.

I am deeply grateful for the condolences you expressed to me yesterday evening by telephone, which I, of course, reported to my government.

Sincerely yours,
Foy D. KOHLER

To His Excellency
A.A. GROMYKO
Minister of Foreign Affairs,
Moscow
