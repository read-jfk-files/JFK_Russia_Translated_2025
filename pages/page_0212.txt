Dear Mr. Ambassador,

From many countries, we receive letters requesting information regarding plans to perpetuate the memory of the late President of the United States. I thought you might be interested in the enclosed statement regarding the construction of the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Library, which will be built in Boston, Massachusetts, on a site located on the banks of the Charles River, provided by Harvard University. President Kennedy chose this location because he wanted the library to be close to where he spent his youth, and also because he wanted it to become part of the university campus located there.

*In the original, the paragraph was written by R.Kennedy by hand in black ink.
