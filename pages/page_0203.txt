11. Oswald acted alone. Regarding his motives, the report contains no definitive conclusion, but notes various factors, such as his bitterness toward any authority, his persistent desire to secure a place in history, his inclination toward violence, and his clearly expressed antagonism toward the United States.

12. It is necessary to improve measures taken to protect the President.
The conclusions reached by the commission should dispel all rumors and speculations regarding whether the President's assassination could have been connected to any conspiracy. A group of prominent American citizens, all of whom are lawyers, devoted thirty-one pages of the report's appendix to refuting point by point various theoretical speculations that had been expressed. Each of these speculations underwent thorough examination during the exhaustive investigation.

The commission was appointed on November 29 of last year by President Johnson to gather facts concerning the assassination of President Kennedy and the killing of Lee Oswald, and to report on them to "the American people and the entire world."

When last Thursday the commission presented its report to President Johnson, he noted that the commission members in their work were guided by "firm determination to establish and publish the complete truth about these terrible events."

"This is our duty," he said, "to the good name of the United States of America and to all people around the world who respect our nation and especially, to the memory of President Kennedy."

In the concluding section of the extensive report, the commission indicates that the conclusions it reached are based on all factual data obtained by it, without any limitations on the investigations conducted.

The report states: The Commission "conducted its own independent investigations, and all government agencies fully fulfilled their obligations regarding cooperation in the commission's investigations."

"These conclusions," the commission report further states, "represent the reasoned and considered judgment of all commission members and are presented after an investigation, the results of which satisfied the commission that it had succeeded in establishing the true events that took place during President Kennedy's assassination, as far as was possible through prolonged and thorough examination of the facts."

The report contains a brief description of events from the moment of President Kennedy, Mrs. Kennedy and their accompanying persons' arrival by plane on November 22 at "Love" airport in Dallas, up until Oswald's killing by Jack Ruby two days later. This is followed by the main conclusions made by the commission and its recommendations regarding how to improve measures for ensuring the President's security.
