the Soviet side's initiative in this matter. Then Rusk inquired whether he could share this correspondence with the special commission recently created by the president, headed by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren. I replied that we leave it entirely to his discretion to familiarize anyone with these materials, being confident that he will properly evaluate our step and act accordingly.

Rusk again expressed gratitude for the provided photocopies. It was noticeable that Rusk was clearly not prepared for such a step from our side, and at the same time, judging by his general behavior, he was pleased with this development of events.

Rusk asked if it would be possible to clarify in Moscow the reasons why Soviet authorities refused to grant Oswald Soviet citizenship when he still lived in the Soviet Union. He promised to convey his request. I await instructions regarding the response to Rusk.

In conclusion, Rusk noted that he hopes for cooperation from the Soviet side if Warren's commission has any requests or questions in connection with their investigation. He, Rusk, would then like to approach me in a confidential manner.

Then Rusk said he wanted to use our meeting to unofficially raise some other questions.

I think, he said, that soon, in 10-15 days, I will be able to inform you (the ambassador) in strictly confidential order about the amount planned by the American government for military expenditures in the budget for the next fiscal year. It will not be larger than the current one, and may even be smaller. Rusk then inquired when we would be reviewing our budget. He didn't ask directly, but it could be understood that he would like to receive some information on this account from us as well in due time.

Rusk emphasized several times that what he said does not mean that the U.S. government is now making some agreement with the USSR government on this matter. It cannot do this for reasons that were already explained in conversations with A.A. Gromyko. Nor can it guarantee that the figures that Rusk intends to
