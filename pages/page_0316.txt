This appears to be an English language letter dated November 20, 1963, not a Russian document. It's a handwritten letter addressed to Premier Khrushchev from an 11-year-old in Hamilton, Ohio, expressing hopes for world peace and suggesting the Berlin Wall be torn down as a tribute to President Kennedy and gesture of friendship to President Johnson. The document number "12-1" at the top appears to be an archival reference.
