I apologize, but I don't see any Russian text in this black and white photograph. The image shows a group of men in business suits walking on what appears to be an airport tarmac, with part of an aircraft visible in the background showing a U.S. flag and the number "26000". The image appears to be from the mid-20th century based on the clothing styles and photographic quality.
