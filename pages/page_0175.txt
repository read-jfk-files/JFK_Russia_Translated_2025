SOVEMBASSY

2054214. In connection with D. Rask's request to inform him of the reasons for Soviet authorities' refusal to grant Oswald Soviet citizenship, you may verbally convey the following to Rask:

"The USSR Constitution and Soviet legislation grant Soviet citizens certain rights and impose corresponding obligations upon them. When considering applications for Soviet citizenship, the competent authorities of the Soviet Union primarily take into account the extent to which the applicant can fulfill the obligations of a USSR citizen and exercise the rights granted to them. The motives for which an individual applies for Soviet citizenship are also taken into consideration.

The Soviet competent authorities who reviewed Oswald's application did not find convincing grounds to conclude that he meets the requirements set forth by the USSR Constitution and legislation for Soviet citizens. The motives that prompted Oswald to submit his application were also unclear. The circumstance that Oswald expressed criticism toward the state of which he was a citizen could not, naturally, be a determining factor in considering his request.

For these reasons, Oswald's application for Soviet citizenship was rejected."

Execute by telegraph.
