To item 6 of protocol No. 111

Dear Mr. President a,

Taking advantage of our Ambassador A. Dobrynin's return to Washington, I would like to express some thoughts regarding the situation developing now after the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons Tests was signed in Moscow.

I think both our governments feel satisfaction about the signing of this Treaty. And it is understandable - after all, the Treaty is such a matter from which none of the parties loses anything; on the contrary, both our countries and other countries of the world, all humanity equally benefit from such an agreement.

A visible evidence of support for this good initiative is, in particular, the fact that immediately after the Treaty was signed by representatives of the USA, USSR and England, many other countries not only declared their readiness to join this Treaty but have already put their signatures under it44. The Soviet government is now receiving a stream of letters, messages, congratulations literally from all corners of the world. Apparently, the White House mail is no less busy. This once again shows that the public worldwide has received considerable satisfaction and welcomes the agreement

a On the first page above the main text is printed: "To His Excellency
Mr. John F. Kennedy,
President of the United States of America
Washington."
