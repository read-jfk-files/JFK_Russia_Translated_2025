(time later).

In conclusion, Rask once again emphasized the confidential nature of the appeal to the Soviet government, expressing hope that it would properly understand the motives for such an appeal.

(The text of the note and a copy of Warren's letter are being transmitted in a separate telegram)218.

Before my departure, Rask inquired whether there was any new information from Moscow regarding the release of American pilots219. I gave him a negative response. In parting, Rask remarked half-jokingly that yesterday, when he spoke at a hearing of one of the congressional committees (on a completely different matter), one congressman, a member of this committee, called Rask a "peacemaker" for his Sunday press conference. Responding to Rask in the same tone, that apparently this gentleman from Congress was not particularly convinced by Rask's presentation of the factual side of the matter, Rask only noted in response that during the press conference, he made every effort to prevent the press from sensationalizing this incident.

On the way from Rask, the accompanying head of the USSR Division of the State Department, Gatrie, drew attention to a "good" editorial in the Washington Post regarding the RB-66 aircraft incident, implying that the State Department was involved here (the article was transmitted via TASS)220. However, Gatrie avoided any other comments on this matter.

The embassy is now receiving quite many telephone inquiries from newspapers and agencies about the exact date of the pilots' release. Overall, the commentary and reactions in the USA regarding Rask's announcement about the Soviet side's intention to return the pilots are generally maintained in a favorable tone for us.
