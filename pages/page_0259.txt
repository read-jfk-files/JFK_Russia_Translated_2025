According to the charter, OAS was created to maintain peace and justice among its member states. The highest body is the General Assembly, and the permanent body is the Permanent Council. In 1962, OAS suspended Cuba's membership in the organization. On December 3, 1963, the OAS Council appointed an investigative commission, as a consultative body, to consider the accusations made by Cuba. As a result of the commission's work, which supported evidence, a series of actions were documented that, in the committee's opinion, were sponsored by Cuba and aimed at undermining Venezuelan institutions and overthrowing Venezuela's democratic government through "terrorism, sabotage, invasions and partisan warfare." Based on the report of July 24, 1964, OAS adopted a resolution on Cuba, obligating all member organizations to sever diplomatic relations with Cuba, suspend all trade with Cuba, except for humanitarian food and medicine supplies, and cease air and sea communications with Cuba.
