Of course, it is impossible to make firm conclusions about the stability of Kennedy's course towards known d√©tente of international tensions and its duration now, given the very complex situation in the USA and the influence of increasingly active extremely reactionary forces; moreover, the danger of international complications related to a number of unresolved problems and the constant threat of US interference in internal affairs of other countries remains, especially regarding American policy towards Cuba.

Under current conditions, we obviously should not act hastily; it is advisable to carefully consider the next steps in order to maintain pressure and achieve more advantageous positions for ourselves on key issues, including by using the specifics of the electoral situation in the USA. This primarily means ensuring non-invasion of Cuba and normalization of the situation in West Berlin within the framework of German peaceful settlement. Simultaneously - continue efforts on issues where possibility of agreement emerged during A.A. Gromyko's conversations with American leaders.
