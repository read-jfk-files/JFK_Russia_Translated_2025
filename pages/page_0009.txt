was received between 19 and 20 hours. By this time, Gromyko was already at home, from where he immediately contacted Khrushchev.

The Soviet leader that evening was at his residence in the Lenin Hills. According to his son Sergei's memories, Khrushchev had returned from Kiev the day before, was preparing for the next Central Committee plenum and "allowed himself to rest a little." When the government communication line rang from the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Khrushchev "was finishing reading evening mail and was about to go upstairs to his second floor"¹³.

Sergei Khrushchev wrote that his father was only informed about the assassination attempt on Kennedy. It remained unclear whether the US President was alive. The First Secretary of the Central Committee instructed Gromyko to contact the ambassador, meaning the US ambassador, and clarify the details. During the conversation, there was a small misunderstanding - the minister thought it necessary to contact the Soviet ambassador in Washington and sent an inquiry there.

Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR L.I. Brezhnev, who held this highest state position at that time, did not have sufficient international experience and was not entirely suitable for such a mission. The Soviet leader proposed to send A.I. Mikoyan - First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU, who had repeatedly carried out special assignments for the Kremlin, the person closest to Khrushchev, who had also visited America multiple times. In addition to official condolences to the new president L. Johnson, Khrushchev suggested sending
