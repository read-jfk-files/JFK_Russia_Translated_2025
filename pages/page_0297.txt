This appears to be an English language document, not a Russian text requiring translation. It's a handwritten letter dated Oct 16, 1959 addressed to "The Supreme Soviet of the USSR" requesting Soviet citizenship. The document appears to be labeled "Document No 2-1" in the top right corner. The letter is written in English and contains a request for Soviet citizenship from a U.S. citizen, detailing their background as a Marine Corps veteran and expressing communist ideological beliefs. Since this is already in English, no translation is needed.
