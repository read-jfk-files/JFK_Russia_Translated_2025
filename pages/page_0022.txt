Signal Copy

For publication in the collection, originals were primarily selected, and only in exceptional cases were copies included, which were typically filed in thematic cases.

Separately, it is necessary to address the question of authenticity or copy status of documents received through encrypted communication channels (cipher telegrams). Upon their receipt at the USSR Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the KGB under the USSR Council of Ministers, 4-5 identical copies were printed from the decrypted text on special forms. In this case, the decrypted initial text, according to the compilers, cannot be defined as the first copy (original) of this type of document.

Documents included in the collection from departmental archives are, as a rule, represented by copies, since the first copies were sent to the addressee. It should also be noted that during this period (1961-1964), when the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent memoranda with draft resolutions to the CPSU Central Committee General Department, simultaneously with the signed original (1st copy), a second and sometimes third copy of the memorandum without signature was received. This is probably related to the specifics of forming originals of Presidium Central Committee CPSU resolutions and thematic files in Sectors I and VI of the Central Committee General Department. Later, according to the compilers' observations, originals of memoranda began to be duplicated in the Central Committee General Department using photocopiers manufactured in Czechoslovakia and GDR.

The published documents can be conditionally divided into several types of groups:

1. Resolutions of the CPSU Central Committee Presidium, adopted both at meetings and during the period between Presidium meetings through polling vote. It was precisely through Presidium resolutions that the main issues related to the collection's theme were regulated. In the archive, the texts of resolutions were preserved in several variants.

In the protocols of the CPSU Central Committee Presidium. Following a Presidium meeting, the General Department prepared a protocol that included all resolutions (except for "Special Folder" resolutions, where only the item number and resolution title were included in the protocol), both those adopted directly at the meeting and decisions made through polling vote in the period after the previous meeting.

The protocol was printed in several versions: the signed version, signed by the First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, and sometimes together with the CPSU Central Committee Secretary presiding at the meeting; archival copy No. 1, which was almost an exact copy of the signed protocol, except for protocol items used for reference work in the Central Committee General Department; distribution copy intended for distribution to CPSU Central Committee members. The latter protocol did not include mentions of "Special Folder" items, as well as most decisions on operational, personnel, and other issues submitted by ministries and departments. Mainly decisions concerning party work organization or major national economic issues remained for distribution.
