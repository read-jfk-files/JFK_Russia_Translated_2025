165 A.I. Mikoyan does not accurately convey the content of the Paris agreements. In accordance with the final act of the London Conference of Nine Powers (Belgium, Canada, France, FRG, Italy, Luxembourg, Great Britain and USA) of October 3, 1954, it was recommended to terminate the occupation regime of FRG and integrate FRG and Italy into the Western European Union and NATO. At the Paris meeting on October 23, 1954, a series of agreements was signed, including Protocol No. III "On Arms Control" to the Treaty on Economic, Social and Cultural Cooperation and Collective Self-Defense of March 17, 1948 (Brussels Treaty). According to this document, the FRG government undertook obligations not to produce atomic, biological and chemical weapons on its territory. It was also determined that "certain additional types of weapons," which included long-range missiles, guided missiles, anti-tank mines, warships, except small vessels for defense purposes (for submarines - no more than 350 tons displacement), shall not be produced on FRG territory, unless the Supreme Commander of NATO Forces makes a recommendation to change or cancel the content of this weapons list, it can be changed (amended) by decision of the Western European Union Council adopted by majority of 23 votes. In late 1950s FRG began designing and building small submarines with displacement of about 350-450 tons for coastal defense. By 1967, 7 submarines of Project 201 and 205 were commissioned. Submarines with displacement over 1000 tons began construction in FRG in early 2000s. The Paris agreements also contained a ban on creating FRG army, but conversely allowed creation of armed forces consisting of 12 infantry divisions, Air Force and Navy.
