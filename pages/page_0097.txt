represents a heavy, very heavy loss for your country. I will say directly that the weight of this loss is felt by the whole world, including us - Soviet people.

I have no need to tell you that the late President John F. Kennedy and I, as the head of government of the socialist Soviet Union, were people of different poles. But I think that you, apparently, and he himself had developed a certain opinion that the awareness of great responsibility for the fate of peace guided in recent years the actions of both governments - both the Soviet Union and the United States of America. These actions were based on the desire to prevent catastrophe and resolve contentious issues through negotiation, taking into account the most important, most fundamental interests of our peoples, the interests of ensuring peace.

The awareness of such responsibility, which I discovered in John F. Kennedy during our very first conversations in Vienna in 1961, laid that invisible bridge of mutual understanding, which, I dare say, was not broken until the last day of President John F.

This, it seems to me, gives us reason to express hope that the foundation that dictated to the leaders of both countries the necessity to prevent the unleashing of a new war and preserve peace will be determining in the development of relations between our two states going forward.

Needless to say that from our side and personally from my side, as head of government of the Soviet Union, there was and is readiness to find through exchange of opinions mutually acceptable solutions to those problems that still divide us. This applies both to problems of European security, remaining for the current generation of people mainly as inheritance from World War II, and to other international problems.

Judging by experience, exchange of opinions and our contacts can take various forms, including through exchange of personal messages, if this does not contradict your wishes. Recently we marked the 30th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations between the USSR and USA. This is a historical act, in which President Franklin D. Roosevelt played an outstanding role. We have always believed that the late President John F. Kennedy, being
