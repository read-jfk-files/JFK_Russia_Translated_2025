CASTRO'S SPEECH

HAVANA, 24 November /TASS/. This evening, the Prime Minister and First Secretary of the National Leadership of the United Socialist Revolutionary Party Fidel Castro spoke on radio and television.

He dedicated his speech to the assassination of President Kennedy and defined Cuba's position in this regard. Characterizing the policy conducted by the Kennedy government, Castro emphasized that it, like Eisenhower's government policy, was hostile and aggressive towards Cuba. However, he said, the news of Kennedy's assassination is serious and tragic for all humanity. After Kennedy's assassination, the most right-wing, most reactionary elements in the United States will try to pursue a policy worse than Kennedy's. Kennedy, Castro noted, was drawn in by ultra-reactionary circles in the United States who disagreed with his policies. These circles considered Kennedy's policy toward Cuba weak. They were not in agreement with the conclusion of the Moscow Treaty and the policy of reducing international tension.

Castro stated that after Kennedy's assassination, the ultra-reactionary circles of the United States launched an anti-Soviet and anti-Cuban hysteria in the country. As proof of this, the Prime Minister cited numerous reports from American news agencies, press, and radio.

In conclusion of his speech, Castro noted that the actions of reactionary elements in the United States pose a serious threat to world peace. "We are least concerned about ourselves," he emphasized. "We care about humanity, about preserving peace. We, as always, are firm and ready to defend the revolution, to defend our homeland."
