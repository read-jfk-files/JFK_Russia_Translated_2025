My attention was drawn to the interlocutor's widely known assessment of Soviet people regarding this event, as it was particularly reflected in the Moscow press. It was also emphasized that much in this connection causes bewilderment and reasonable doubts, since, in particular, to date, as far as one can judge, exhaustive and conclusive facts of the monstrous crime in Dallas have not been made public.

Referring to the fact that, as a member of the Warren Commission, he had recently been directly involved in studying all materials related to the case, McCloy said that commission members studied not only multi-volume files but also familiarized themselves with the situation in Dallas, trying to reconstruct the true picture of Kennedy's assassination. A thorough investigation of all facts related to the case, McCloy emphasized, leads the commission to the only correct conclusion that the true assassin of President Kennedy was indeed Oswald.

Everything indicates, the interlocutor continued, that Oswald acted alone and was not involved in any conspiratorial plot with others. During the investigation, it was established that Oswald attempted to assassinate General Walker234, was preparing to kill Nixon and others.

If one were to follow the path of the assassin's connections with any hidden forces, McCloy continued, then "I carefully weigh my words â€“ threads could lead beyond the USA, especially since, as is known, Oswald lived in the USSR for a certain period, from where he returned with a Russian wife and subsequently behaved very suspiciously in the USA." We know, the interlocutor added, that Oswald's very stay in the Soviet Union was "unusual and he must have been under surveillance by corresponding Soviet security organs." McCloy noted that the American side does not have exhaustive data that would allow reconstructing the complete picture, including the period of Oswald's stay in the Soviet Union.

To my remark that our embassy in Washington, as is known, had in its time transmitted materials to the State Department, McCloy said that he is familiar with these materials, but they are "very laconic and do not allow composing a complete picture of Oswald's stay in the USSR."

As if wishing to emphasize his thought again, McCloy stressed that all materials available to the Warren Commission "undoubtedly indicate that
