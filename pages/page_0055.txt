The treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons testing has breathed fresh air into the international atmosphere, showing that, no matter how complex modern problems are, no matter how great the differences between the social systems of our states, we can find mutually acceptable solutions in the interests of all humanity, in the interests of maintaining peace, if we show the necessary aspiration for this.

However, of course, the agreement on the prohibition of experimental nuclear explosions, with all its importance for nations, does not by itself solve the main international problem of our era - it does not eliminate the danger of war. Now it is necessary - and our governments have spoken in favor of this - to develop the achieved success further, to seek solutions to other pressing international issues.

These issues are well known; they are brought forward by life itself, by all development of world events. These include strengthening security in Europe, including the elimination of remnants of World War II, concluding a non-aggression pact between NATO countries and Warsaw Pact member states, creating nuclear-free zones in various regions of the world, preventing further proliferation of nuclear weapons, prohibiting the placement of objects with nuclear weapons on board into orbit, measures to prevent sudden attack, and several other steps. Their implementation would contribute significantly to strengthening peace, improving international relations, would clear the path to universal and complete disarmament and, consequently, to freeing peoples from the threat of war.

The peoples expect that our governments will now show even more persistence and consistency in their further actions in the interests of strengthening peace. As for the Soviet government, invariably guided by the course toward peaceful coexistence of states, it is ready to make new efforts, to do everything in its power to ensure that the shift toward better international conditions, which emerged as a result of concluding the nuclear test ban treaty, becomes the beginning of a sharp turn toward broad international d√©tente.

Allow me, Mr. President, to express hope that the United States government will, for its part, make an appropriate contribution to solving international problems required by the interests of reducing international tension and ensuring universal peace.

Respectfully,
N. KHRUSHCHEV
