It seems appropriate to send R. Kennedy a reply letter on behalf of Comrade Khrushchev N.S., which would contain a brief assessment of J. Kennedy as a person and statesman, prepared based on Comrade Khrushchev N.S.'s public statements on this matter. The letter should indicate that, in connection with R. Kennedy's request, the following items will be transmitted to the Kennedy library through the USSR Embassy in Washington: a Soviet documentary film about Comrade Khrushchev N.S.'s meeting with J. Kennedy in Vienna in June 1961, a tape recording of the concluding part of Comrade Khrushchev N.S.'s speech on June 15, 1961, in Moscow about the results of the Vienna meeting, which discusses impressions from conversations with President Kennedy, as well as some TASS photo chronicles and Soviet press materials.

It should be noted that Robert Kennedy has also approached Comrade Mikoyan A.N., Gromyko A.A., Adzhubei A.I., and Dobrynin A.F. with a similar request to contribute to the creation of the Kennedy Library and record their memories of the late president. It seems appropriate to instruct Ambassador Dobrynin, when delivering Comrade N.S. Khrushchev's letter, to convey to Robert Kennedy that the materials being transferred represent our common contribution to the creation of J. Kennedy's memorial library.

To Mr. Robert F. Kennedy
Attorney General of the United States of America, Washington

Dear Mr. Kennedy,

I received your letter in which you inform about plans to create a library in Boston in memory of your brother John F. Kennedy. You express a wish that we participate in the implementation of these plans. We regard with understanding the intention to create John F. Kennedy's memorial library and are ready to contribute to this cause. Through the Soviet Embassy in Washington, you will be provided with certain Soviet documents and materials relating to President Kennedy's foreign policy activities, especially in the area of Soviet-American relations.
