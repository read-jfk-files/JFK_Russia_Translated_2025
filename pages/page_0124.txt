return the islands to Japan. I told Ikeda that I had been on these islands a few days after the end of the war. I saw your disarmed soldiers there. I saw how few people lived on these islands. If Japan were to build one chemical plant based on imported Far Eastern timber, it could employ the entire population of these islands. Ikeda noted that fishing is of great importance there. I said that both we and the USSR and Japan now fish in all oceans, where Soviet fishing fleets often meet with Japanese ones.

Regarding economic relations, I said that Soviet-Japanese trade is developing. I liked that the Japanese government responded with refusal to the Western proposal about going to Paris for a meeting on trade with socialist countries¹⁴⁶. The statement says that Japan will decide this issue independently.

Ikeda wanted to object to something. But at this time the Foreign Minister intervened, explaining that this was exactly how it happened.

I spoke in favor of expanding trade between the USSR and Japan. Ikeda said that the Soviet Union should buy more in Japan and pay in cash. Japan has no money, and you demand credits, he added.

I said that we don't demand money, but goods on credit, and we pay accurately. I stated that N.S. Khrushchev will soon present a program for accelerated development of our chemical industry¹⁴⁷, and that Japan could receive large orders under this program if it agrees to more favorable credit terms. He said: "Good."

4. The Prime Minister of Sweden, Erlander, approached me. He said that in Sweden they are awaiting N.S. Khrushchev's visit. Erlander thinks it would be good if N.S. Khrushchev came to Sweden in summer¹⁴⁸. In this case, he could familiarize himself with agriculture, which, as is known, interests him.

I agreed with his opinion and noted that the Soviet government has not yet discussed the timing of N.S. Khrushchev's trip to Scandinavia, although the invitation has been renewed. Added that N.S. Khrushchev is indeed interested in agriculture. Moreover, he sets before the Baltic republics, which have climatic conditions similar to Sweden, the task of achieving the same level of agricultural development as they have. The conversation took place in a friendly atmosphere.

5. The conversation with the Yugoslav delegation was friendly in nature. No special issues were discussed.

6. The Emperor of Ethiopia approached me. He recalled his stay in Moscow¹⁴⁹. At the reception, he did not touch upon the issue of our arms sales to Somalia¹⁵⁰. However, after the reception, he passed me an invitation to meet with him for a conversation, which took place today and during which he raised this issue. This conversation is reported separately¹⁵¹.
