nuclear tests, on the creation of nuclear-free zones in various regions of the globe, on the withdrawal of foreign troops from foreign territories, on the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and resolving on this basis the question of West Berlin⁴, on the conclusion of a non-aggression pact between member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and member countries of the Warsaw Treaty⁵.

One could cite many examples of concrete, purposeful activities of the Soviet government both within the UN framework and in various commissions, committees and subcommittees, where practical proposals were made on the aforementioned and many other disputed and unresolved issues.

In President Kennedy's speech, he emphasizes the existence of real danger to peace, including for the United States of America⁶, as a result of the arms race and accumulation of vast quantities of nuclear weapons. He correctly states that in modern conditions, world war is especially senseless, as it would inevitably lead to enormous human casualties and destruction of material values created by the labor of many generations. He also justly notes that the arms race, if not stopped, could lead to military catastrophe. Nuclear bombs are not cucumbers that can be stored in a warehouse and kept for quite long in a preserved state.

Also noteworthy is the President's statement that world war in modern conditions is not inevitable. As is known, this conclusion was made by us long ago. From what has been said, it is clear that the speech contains several positive points, indicating a sober assessment of the real situation⁷.

Reading the U.S. President's speech, one cannot help but notice some contradictory positions contained within it.

The President speaks about the necessity of ending the "cold war." However, in declaring this, does the U.S. President seek to eliminate the sources of the "cold war"? This is not evident from the speech.

Let us take, for example, one of the most important problems - the question of concluding a German peace treaty.

President Kennedy states: "Our commitment to defend Western Europe and West Berlin, for instance, remains unchanged due to the identity of our vital interests. The United States will not make any deal with the Soviet Union at the expense of other countries and other peoples not only because they are our partners, but because their interests and our interests coincide."
