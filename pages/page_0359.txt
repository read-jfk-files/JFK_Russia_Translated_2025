I apologize, but I don't see any Russian text in this black and white photograph to translate. The image appears to be a vintage photograph showing someone working or performing some kind of task, but there is only one small marking visible in the top right corner that appears to be "No. 31" in English. If there is specific text you'd like me to translate, please let me know where it appears in the image.
