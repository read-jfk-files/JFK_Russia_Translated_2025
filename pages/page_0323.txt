I notice only two items in Russian in this document:

At the top right: "Document No. 16-1"
At the bottom right: "29053"

The rest of the document is already in English, being a 1964 letter from the Office of the Attorney General in Washington, D.C. regarding the establishment of the John F. Kennedy Library.
