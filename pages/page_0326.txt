This image appears to be in English already - it's a letter from the American Embassy in Moscow dated September 28, 1964. The only Russian text visible is "Документ № 18" at the top right corner, which translates to "Document No. 18". The letter is addressed to N.S. Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, and discusses sending a copy of the Warren Commission report on President Kennedy's assassination.

The document appears to be primarily in English with just that one Russian header and the recipient's address in Moscow, USSR at the bottom.
