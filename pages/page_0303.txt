This appears to be an English language document dated Dec 1, 1960, not a Russian text. It's a handwritten letter requesting information about American citizenship status and the possibility of returning to the United States. The only non-English text visible is "Документ № 6-2" (Document No. 6-2) in the top right corner.

The letter is written in English cursive handwriting and begins "Dear Sirs," followed by inquiries about citizenship matters and legal implications of potentially returning to America. The writer requests confidential handling of the correspondence, referencing some previous application made in October 1957.
