himself a vein. At present, after treatment, he continues to insist on being granted Soviet citizenship and refuses to leave the USSR. On October 31 of this year, he visited the US Embassy in Moscow and declared his renunciation of American citizenship.

Considering that certain foreigners previously granted Soviet citizenship (Sitrinell, Afshar), after living for some time in the USSR, left our country, and also taking into account that Oswald has not yet been sufficiently studied, it is advisable to grant him the right of temporary residence in the USSR for one year, providing him with work and housing. In this case, the question of Oswald's permanent residence in the Soviet Union and his acceptance into Soviet citizenship could be decided upon the expiration of this period.

Draft resolution is attached. We request consideration.
