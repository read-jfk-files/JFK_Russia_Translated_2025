No. 94
Letter from L.H. Oswald to the Consular Section of the US Embassy in the USSR requesting
information about his possible return to the USA

December 1, 1960

Dear Sirs!

I would like to receive information regarding the status of my American citizenship, especially concerning my return to the USA and the problems that would need to be resolved if I wished to return to America.

I ask only to be informed. I believe we can discuss this matter fully before any steps are taken by me or anyone else.

I would also like this correspondence to be kept secret, as the "popularity" which I acquired in October 1959, when I submitted my application to renounce American citizenship, only led to complications.

You can send any personal letters for me to the embassy at the address indicated below.

Thank you,
Lee Harvey Oswald.
