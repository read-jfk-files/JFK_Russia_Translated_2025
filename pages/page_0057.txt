consider - after all, in the previous election, almost half of Americans voted for the obvious reactionary Nixon.

While harboring no great illusions about Kennedy himself, it appears undoubtable that his re-election as US President for a new term would be the most preferable option for us, since any possible Republican Party presidential candidate (not to mention figures like Goldwater or Nixon), due to the very logic of inter-party struggle in US conditions, will inevitably campaign from positions more right-wing than Kennedy's on issues of relations with the Soviet Union.

An important point in this connection - both from the perspective of characterizing the current Kennedy administration's line on questions of war and peace, and from the perspective of this moment's known binding influence on the future government policy - is Kennedy's already sufficiently defined intention at present to build his election campaign under the slogan of preserving peace and gradual normalization of the international situation. Kennedy's line consists of maximally utilizing the favorable situation in the country that developed as a result of the Moscow Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Tests (which he became convinced of during his recent trip through 12 western states) in the interests of strengthening his positions in the election campaign. Kennedy is interested in maintaining this favorable situation, although regarding further steps to reduce international tension, one should expect - taking into account internal and inter-party struggle - that the current administration will delay their discussion, in any case moving forward very cautiously.

A not unimportant factor for us regarding the future president is also the question of Cuba, since any new president will not be bound by the agreement between the heads of both governments that was reached during the Cuban crisis in October of last year. The personal relationships that have already developed between the heads of the USSR and USA governments also have certain significance.

Kennedy's position - in light of electoral factors - is quite complex at present. It is further aggravated by the circumstance that a general expansion of opposition forces against him is occurring here now, connected primarily with the problem of civil rights for the Negro population of the country. The point is that, having put forward under pressure from the stormy growth of the Negro movement a rather broad legislative program to ensure equal rights for Negroes with whites, Kennedy thereby definitively pushed away the southern wing of the Democratic Party, and also turned against himself certain other segments of the population, including among labor unions, which, consisting mostly of white workers, in purely self-interested considerations
