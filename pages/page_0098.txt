representative of the same political party, to some extent continued Roosevelt's foreign policy traditions based on recognizing that the coinciding interests of the USSR and USA dominate over what divides them.

To you, Mr. President, as a representative of the same direction in US politics that brought to the forefront of political life such statesmen as Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy, I want to say that if these great traditions continue to be supported and strengthened, then, in our conviction, both Americans and Soviet people could look optimistically to the future. We are convinced that every state would sympathize with such development of events, and moreover, every person who stands for peace and cherishes peace.

If you wish to express your thoughts in connection with these ideas, even if somewhat general in nature, which I considered possible to share with you in this message, I would welcome this.

Respectfully,
N. KHRUSHCHEV
