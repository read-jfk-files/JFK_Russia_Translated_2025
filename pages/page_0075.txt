Rusk stated that the United States is ready to discuss with the Soviet Union possible ways to develop Soviet-American trade, as well as related issues.

From our side, it was stated to the Americans that it is necessary to end the discriminatory U.S. policy regarding trade with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, that this would be an important stage in the development of Soviet-American relations and would serve the interests of the USA, USSR and other countries. It was emphasized that Americans should not think in any case that only the Soviet Union would benefit from trade development. This is a matter of mutual interest and mutual benefit.

An agreement was reached that at this stage specially designated representatives from the USSR and USA would conduct an unofficial exchange of views to explore possibilities for developing Soviet-American trade. The Americans requested that this exchange not be publicized for now.
