This appears to be an English language document from the White House dated December 2, 1963. It's a letter addressed to Chairman Khrushchev, written in English, with only the document number "Document No. 15" at the top in Russian (Документ № 15). The letter is from the White House to Nikita S. Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in Moscow. There isn't any Russian text to translate besides the document number notation.
