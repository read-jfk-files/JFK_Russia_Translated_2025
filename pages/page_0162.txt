in private conversations with many officials regarding Castro. This, Reston said, personally concerns him greatly from the perspective of unpredictable international consequences if Cuba somehow becomes involved in the Oswald case.

Reston emphasized that Johnson and especially Rusk clearly understand the potential danger of such complications, and they have quietly taken several measures to avoid inflaming passions and not give any additional grounds for speculation from their side. Johnson's creation of a commission headed by Chief Justice Warren reflects American leaders' desire to concentrate the entire Oswald case in one place and cut off various conjectures and fabrications that only damage the international prestige of the USA.

And with his instinct and ability to navigate political moods within the USA, Johnson, Reston noted, has long been well-known among his former colleagues - senators and leaders of both parties.

During the conversation, Reston noted that as far as he could judge, Johnson is positively disposed toward meeting with N.S. Khrushchev during the next year and that in his, Reston's, opinion such a meeting could take place in late spring or early
