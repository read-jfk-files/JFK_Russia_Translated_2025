of the Warsaw Treaty), which existed until February 25, 1991. The Non-Aggression Pact project between the states - members of the Warsaw Treaty and the states - members of the North Atlantic Treaty was submitted by the USSR to the Committee of Eighteen States on Disarmament in Geneva on February 20, 1963. The project was published on February 21, 1963 (newspaper "Pravda", 1963. February 21, No. 109).

From 1895 to 1945, Taiwan, after China's defeat in the Japanese-Chinese War of 1894-1895, became part of Japan. After Japan's defeat in 1945, the armed forces of the Republic of China restored control over Taiwan. After the defeat of the Kuomintang in the civil war, the remaining troops of the Chinese Republic and a significant number of civilian refugees evacuated to the island. The USA in 1950, in connection with the beginning of the Korean War and the participation of Chinese PVA troops, began to actively support the Kuomintang regime in Taiwan. In December 1954, a Mutual Defense Treaty was signed between the Republic of China and the USA.

With the beginning of the Cold War, the USA began to apply a new type of economic sanctions against the USSR and socialist bloc countries. They were aimed at blocking access to advanced technologies and high-tech products. On March 26, 1948, the US Department of Commerce restricted the export of strategic materials, equipment and supplies to the USSR and Eastern European countries and the PRC.

At the end of February 1949, these restrictions were enshrined in the new Export Control Act (previously the export control law was adopted in 1940, aimed mainly against Axis countries). To implement restrictive measures in 1949, the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) was created by the USA, which supervised the supply of goods and technologies from Western countries to the USSR and its allies. COCOM included 16 countries (USA, Canada, Australia, Great Britain, Belgium, Denmark, France, FRG, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey). Six more states cooperated with the committee (Austria, Finland, Ireland, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland), but formally were not its members. In the mid-1950s, Japan became a member of COCOM. The committee's task was to develop and observe the strategy of "controlled technological lag." All technologies were divided into three categories: completely prohibited for sale; allowed for sale in limited quantities, without export restrictions, but with control over their final use. Even this third category had limitations. Products from the third list (for technology not manufactured in socialist countries) could be sold only four years after mass production began. All contracts for the supply of products, including technologies, to socialist countries worth over 100 million dollars were subject to COCOM approval. Any member state of the committee could veto the deal, suggesting it to other committee participants. Along with these decisions, in 1951 the USA tightened economic restrictions on exports to socialist countries in connection with the war in Korea (1950-1953) and terminated the 1937 trade agreement with the Soviet government, depriving the USSR of most-favored-nation status. As a result, customs tariffs on Soviet goods increased by 4.6 times compared to the level of taxation of goods from other countries. The American Congress passed the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act. According to this document, the USA could deny economic support (for example, deny most-favored-nation treatment in trade) to any state that did not join the embargo against the USSR and "countries under its influence" and continue to supply them with strategic goods.

This refers to mutual visits of foreign trade specialists to study organization, techniques and practices of foreign trade activities. The visits were planned for 30 days each. The Soviet delegation headed by the chief of the Main Currency Department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade of the USSR V.S. Alkhimov was in the USA from May 15, 1963, the US delegation in the USSR - from July 15.

The conversation record was prepared on August 8, 1963, at 12 noon it arrived at the Secretariat of the Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, was sent on August 13 as No. P1310 to members and candidate members of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee, secretaries of the CPSU Central Committee.

The information message about N.S. Khrushchev's reception of D. Rusk was published on August 6, 1963 (newspaper "Pravda". 1963. August 6. No. 218).

The Eighteen Nation Committee on Disarmament (ENDC) was established by the United Nations Organization in 1961. It began work on March 14, 1962, in Geneva (Switzerland) and met regularly until August 26, 1969. It included participants who were active in 1960-1961 in the Ten Nation Committee on Disarmament (USSR, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, USA, Great Britain, France, Canada, Italy), as well as Brazil, Burma, India, Mexico, Ethiopia, United Arab Republic, Nigeria, Sweden. Within the committee, issues of disarmament, measures to strengthen trust and control over nuclear tests were considered.
