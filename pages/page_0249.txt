determined that "states - parties to the Treaty undertake not to place in orbit around Earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other types of weapons of mass destruction."

58 The consular convention between the USSR government and the US government was signed on June 1, 1964.

59 Preliminary negotiations on concluding an air transport agreement between the USSR and USA were conducted from the late 1950s. After relations cooled following the U-2 spy plane incident in May 1960, negotiations were suspended, resuming in late 1960. The text of the agreement was approved in August 1961, but due to the Berlin crisis (1961) and Caribbean crisis (1962) the agreement was not signed. The bilateral air transport agreement between the USSR and USA was signed in Washington on November 4, 1966.

60 On October 21, 1963, a delegation headed by the First Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade of the USSR B.A. Borisov was sent to the USA for negotiations with the State Department, Departments of Trade and Agriculture regarding wheat purchases for the USSR. On November 21, negotiations were interrupted at the Soviet side's initiative due to American firms' unwillingness to sell grain at fixed prices and the necessity of delivery on American ships. The grain deficit was eliminated through increased supplies from Canada and Australia.

61 This refers to the draft statement text delivered by A.A. Gromyko during the meeting with J.F. Kennedy on October 10, 1963. The Soviet side proposed publishing the statement text when signing the Non-Aggression Pact between Warsaw Pact member states and NATO member states (see note 5).

62 The initial plan for creating multilateral nuclear forces (MLF, in published documents another name is also used â€“ combined NATO nuclear forces) was prepared by US State Secretary C. Herter in late 1960 and presented to NATO's five nuclear powers. Other NATO countries' contribution consisted of purchasing American "Polaris" missiles for MLF, which would be under collective command. The MLF's purpose was to strengthen NATO's European members' control over their own defense while maintaining centralized control over nuclear weapons use; raise the FRG's status in NATO by involving it in nuclear planning and thereby reduce the danger of West German nuclear forces plans emerging. In early 1963, the US completed developing a detailed MLF creation plan. Ultimately, the American project proposed that MLF would consist of 25 surface ships, each carrying 8 Polaris missiles, with mixed crews comprising citizens of at least three NATO member states. Control over nuclear missile launches was assigned to representatives of MLF member countries. Decisions in this committee were to be made unanimously, allowing the US to retain its veto right on nuclear weapons use. Western Germany showed the greatest interest in MLF, seeing in NATO collective nuclear forces plans an opportunity to join nuclear planning and thus raise its status in the North Atlantic alliance. USSR leadership strongly objected to plans for FRG and other nuclear weapons involvement. Great Britain and France, based on their own interests, also did not support the MLF plan. Great Britain proposed an alternative Atlantic Nuclear Forces (ANF) plan, while France, opposing both MLF and ANF, proposed creating European nuclear forces. Under these conditions, hesitation and objections regarding MLF gradually increased in the US. By the end of 1964, practically all negotiations on MLF creation were terminated.

63 The Caribbean Crisis of 1962 (called the "Cuban Missile Crisis" in the US and the "October Crisis" in Cuba) was the most acute military-political crisis in Soviet-American relations during the Cold War period. The crisis was provoked by the rise to power in 1959 in Cuba of F. Castro's government, which took a course toward rapprochement with the USSR, as well as the deployment of US and NATO medium-range missiles around USSR borders. In May 1962, the CPSU Central Committee Presidium decided to deploy missiles in Cuba. In early July 1962, a Soviet-Cuban secret agreement was drafted in Moscow on deploying Soviet missiles in Cuba. To deliver and place R-12 and R-14 missile systems, air defense equipment, other equipment, and also a military grouping of Soviet forces in Cuba, Operation "Anadyr" (July 17 - October 22, 1962) was carried out and the Group of Soviet Forces in Cuba (GSFK) was formed. N.S. Khrushchev planned to inform J.F. Kennedy about the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba in November 1962, during their upcoming meeting at the UN General Assembly, but American intelligence put the American side before an accomplished fact. On October 14, 1962, American reconnaissance confirmed the presence of Soviet missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads on the island. On October 22, J.F. Kennedy made a television address announcing Soviet missiles in Cuba, about the US threat, and the introduction (from October 24) of a "quarantine" of Cuba aimed at preventing the deployment of "Soviet
