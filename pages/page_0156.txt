In conclusion, Rask again asked to consider our conversation unofficial, conducted "as if in a home setting". The entire conversation was one-on-one. No one else was in the office.

Rask looks very tired, eyes red from insomnia ("I currently sleep 3-4 hours a day," noted Rask), but he himself is animated, in clearly good spirits and presents himself as a person confident in his current position, despite the change of presidents.

Dear Mr. Mikoyan,

I simply wanted you to know how touched I was to receive your condolences regarding my brother's death, and how grateful we all were that you came to Washington and attended the funeral.

The President believed that thanks to your efforts and the efforts being made here, in the United States, we are all on the path to achieving a genuine breakthrough toward peace throughout the world.
