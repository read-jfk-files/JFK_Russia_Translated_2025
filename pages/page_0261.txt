214 General Edwin Walker was known for his conservative anti-communist views. Since 1961, he had been retired. In early 1962, he lost primary elections for the post of Texas governor. In October 1962, he was arrested for inciting riots at the University of Mississippi, which occurred in protest against the admission of African American students to the university. By order of the US Attorney General R.Kennedy, he was placed in a psychiatric hospital for 90-day observation, but as a result of protests by psychiatrists and lawyers, was released after 5 days. On April 11, 1963, E. Walker reported that on April 10 an attempt was made on his life in his own home, but he avoided serious injuries as the bullet, fired from outside, hit the window frame and shattered into fragments. The Warren Commission concluded that L.H. Oswald was the one who shot at the general.
