52 By November 1963, the Republican Party had not yet definitively decided on a party candidate for the upcoming 1964 presidential election. The main candidates were New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller (representing the liberal wing of the party) and Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater (representing the conservative wing). The president's assassination shocked Republican primaries: in connection with mourning, N. Rockefeller suspended his campaign for a month, and candidates who had not yet voted declined to openly nominate their candidacy.

53 As vice president in President D. Eisenhower's administration (1953-1961), R. Nixon ran for president from the Republican Party in the 1960 election but was defeated by Democrat J.F. Kennedy.

54 On June 11, 1963, J.F. Kennedy delivered a radio and television address on civil rights. In it, referring to the events of that day at the University of Alabama, where Governor D. Wallace of Alabama tried to prevent two first Black students from entering the university, he called for recognizing civil rights as a moral cause. On June 19, J.F. Kennedy submitted a civil rights bill to Congress, which he supported. On November 23, L. Johnson after moving to draft "Remarks to Joint Session" addressed a joint session of both houses of Congress with the words "No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill." The Civil Rights Act, prohibiting discrimination based on race, skin color, gender, or ethnic origin, was passed by Congress (10 February 1964) and the US Senate (19 June 1964). Signed by US President L. Johnson on July 2, 1964.

55 In January 1963, J.F. Kennedy introduced a bill to Congress that provided for reducing the maximum income tax rate from 91 to 65 percent and reducing the corporate tax rate from 52 to 47 percent. The bill also included provisions to help poor people and invalids. During consideration in Congress, the bill was blocked by Republicans who understood that its adoption could play a key role in J.F. Kennedy's victory in the presidential election. After J.F. Kennedy's death, L. Johnson, agreeing to reduce the overall federal budget, pushed the bill through the chambers. On February 26, 1964, the US Revenue Act was signed by the president.

56 This refers to the ideological polemic that began in 1963 between the CPSU Central Committee and the CPC Central Committee. By the end of the 1950s, negative tendencies began to appear in Soviet-Chinese relations, active bilateral cooperation began to transform into confrontation between the two largest socialist states. In ideological terms between the USSR and the PRC, different understandings of the problems of war and peace, forms and methods of struggle between socialism and capitalism, ways of building socialism emerged. On April 3, 1963, the newspaper "Pravda" published "Letter of the CPSU CC to the CPC CC" dated March 30. It followed from it that in relations between two socialist states there may be "different understanding of certain issues of internal construction and the international communist movement" (newspaper "Pravda", 1963, April 3, No. 93). The letter also spoke about the upcoming bilateral consultative meeting. Despite this, the PRC responded to criticism by publishing its letter "On the General Line of the International Communist Movement." It spoke about the need to strive for the victory of world revolution, and also made attacks on the CPSU's program provisions. This was followed by a return Statement of the CPSU Central Committee of June 19, which indicated that due to the upcoming party delegation of the USSR and PRC, the Chinese side's letter cannot be published (newspaper "Pravda", 1963, June 19, No. 170). The unsuccessful course of Soviet-Chinese bilateral consultations held from July 5 in Moscow led to the fact that the Soviet leadership was forced to publish both the CPC CC letter and give it a response in the form of a detailed letter. On July 14, both documents were published: "Open Letter of the CPC CC" addressed to "party organizations and all communists of the Soviet Union" (newspaper "Pravda", 1963, July 14, No. 195). The CPSU CC letter of July 14 became the foundation for criticism of Chinese leadership during 1963-1964. The CPC responded to the "Open Letter of the CPSU CC" by publishing in China 9 polemical articles. Following the last letter of the CPSU CC published in the "People's Daily" newspaper several articles that became a comprehensive subject for public criticism of the CPC from the CPSU: "The emergence and development of disagreements between the CPSU leadership and us" (September 6); "On the question of Stalin" (September 13); "Is Yugoslavia a socialist country?" (September 26); "Apologists of neo-colonialism" (October 22); "Two lines on the issue of war and peace" (November 19); "Diametrically opposed policies of peaceful coexistence" (December 12); "CPSU leaders are the greatest splitters of our time" (February 4, 1964) and others.
