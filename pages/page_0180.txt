Yesterday, on the eve of Christmas holidays, Robert Kennedy visited me on his own initiative.

He said that on the eve of these holidays he wanted to thank the Soviet government and its head N.S. Khrushchev on behalf of Jacqueline Kennedy and himself for "the human sympathy and feelings expressed by them in the grief that has befallen the entire Kennedy family." R. Kennedy especially emphasized the personal respect that the late president had for the Soviet premier, and the hopes he spoke of shortly before his death for significant improvement in Soviet-American relations after the 1964 re-election.

Further referring to the fact that he and I have "special personal relations, strengthened by the Cuban crisis and the trust shown to us by both heads of governments," R. Kennedy asked me to keep in mind that in the future, whatever post he might hold, he would always be ready to meet with me and provide appropriate strong assistance in the interests of both our countries.
