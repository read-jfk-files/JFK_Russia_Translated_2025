101 This refers to Robert (Bobby) Baker, who since 1943 worked in the U.S. Congress, beginning as a page. When L. Johnson became majority leader in the Senate in 1955, he appointed R. Baker as secretary of the majority. In the early 60s, Baker began to be investigated for corruption and providing services in transferring bribes to Senate members. He also provided services in organizing politicians' leisure, including meetings with women, at the organized Quorum Club. Baker introduced the club's hostess E. Rometsch to J.F. Kennedy. Director E. Gurev considered Rometsch an East German spy. Information about this connection in 1963 was reported by Baker to L. Johnson and was widely covered in the press. Although officially his only earnings was the salary of majority secretary, in 1963 he became a millionaire. All these events drew the attention of the Ministry of Justice. R. Kennedy discovered that Baker was connected to several "Mafia bosses" and also tried to prove that L. Johnson was involved in corruption schemes. On October 7, 1963, Baker was forced to resign and the press circulated reports that the White House insists on investigating the Baker case to put L. Johnson in a difficult position: "Kennedy wants to use the Baker case to cross out Johnson from the list next year." Only in 1967 was Baker found guilty on seven counts of theft, fraud and tax evasion and sentenced to three years in prison, but served only sixteen months.
102 This refers to U.S. Secretary of the Navy Frederick Korth, who resigned on October 14, 1963 after a conflict with U.S. Secretary of Defense R. McNamara. At the same time, information spread in Congress and the press regarding the R. Baker case (see note 101), that F. Korth, who before his presidential appointment as president of Continental National Bank (Texas), made a corrupt decision by awarding a contract worth 7 billion dollars to a Texas firm for creating the experimental tactical fighter F-111. On October 31 at a press conference J.F. Kennedy stated that all these "fabrications" were unfounded.

106 The quote attributed to V.I. Lenin, allegedly said by him in 1887 after the execution of his older brother Alexander. According to the memoirs of Lenin's sister M.I. Ulyanova, Vladimir Ilyich said the following: "No, we will take a different path. Not this path should be taken." The phrase "We will take a different path" gained circulation after the publication in 1924 of V.V. Mayakovsky's poem "Vladimir Ilyich Lenin."
