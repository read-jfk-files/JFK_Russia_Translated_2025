by the majority of the American people; and the peoples of the Soviet Union have always stood and stand* on these positions. We strive to ensure that good relations between countries are implemented in practice, but to achieve this, efforts must not be spared in the struggle with those forces** that stand for waging a "cold war" and resolving disputed issues through starting a war.

In these concrete actions, the American government will find understanding and support from the Soviet government.

For our part, we will spare no effort to find solutions to unresolved problems, to establish good relations between our great powers.
