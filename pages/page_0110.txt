[Signal Copy]

attempt to justify their insinuations with references to the fact that Oswald was in the Soviet Union from October 1959 to June 1962.

The USSR Ministry of Foreign Affairs and KGB under the USSR Council of Ministers have prepared a statement for the Soviet press aimed at exposing these fabrications of the American press. The draft statement has been prepared based on the fact that now, when Oswald himself is dead, the true face of those circles who are responsible for President Kennedy's assassination and who are clearly trying to cover their tracks becomes even more apparent. The question of the expediency of such publication requires special consideration taking into account further developments related to the investigation of Kennedy's assassination circumstances.

If American authorities approach the Soviet embassy in Washington with a request to provide them with some information about Oswald's stay in the Soviet Union, corresponding information on this matter could be provided to them.

Draft resolution is attached.
Please review.
