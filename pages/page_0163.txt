Visited Thompson at his request.
Thompson conveyed to me the following confidential message from President Johnson to N.S. Khrushchev:

"The White House, Washington
December 2, 1963

Dear Mr. Chairman:

I am sending you these few personal words simply to express my appreciation that your government has provided us with certain documents concerning Lee Harvey Oswald. We highly value any information that may be useful to us in clarifying all doubts surrounding this deeply tragic event, and I want to express my personal gratitude for your help.

I would also like to take this opportunity to gratefully acknowledge receipt of the substantive and constructive letter delivered to me by Mr. Mikoyan, and to tell you directly what I already told him: that I am deeply convinced of the value of direct and personal correspondence between you and me - in addition to those important matters which, naturally, go through official channels - in all cases when such personal correspondence can be useful in the interests of peace.

Mrs. Johnson joins me in sending best wishes to you and Mrs. Khrushcheva.

Sincerely,
Lyndon B. Johnson"
