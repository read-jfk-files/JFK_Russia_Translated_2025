Remembering now about President J.F. Kennedy, I would particularly like to draw attention to his speech at American University in Washington on June 10, 1963. This statement can be called courageous and more realistic than what the Soviet Union and other socialist countries often heard from American shores. Although this statement by the U.S. President contained contradictory elements and paid tribute, unfortunately, to the so-called policy of "containing and rolling back communism," overall it proceeded from recognizing the inevitability and necessity of coexistence between states with different social systems.

Today I would not want to dwell in detail on the negative aspects of this statement by J.F. Kennedy because, I repeat, it contained the main idea: in this statement, the President said: "Let us review our attitude toward the Soviet Union"; he said that "peace need not be impracticable, and war need not be inevitable."

President Kennedy understood that it was in the interests of the United States itself and the improvement of international politics as a whole for the United States to seek positions that would ensure peaceful coexistence of states with different social structures. This statement reflected a more correct understanding that disputed issues between states cannot be resolved through war, because no sensible person, especially if they recognize the opposing side as their equal in military power, would start a war.

This speech by J.F. Kennedy, as one might suppose, was somewhat preparatory, as the president was outlining a platform for a future election campaign. Although everyone knows that President J.F. Kennedy was a person of ideology opposite to ours, representing interests of a state standing on a political platform opposite to ours, in this speech he was already outlining more realistic principles for relations between countries with different social structures and, thus, if we extend his thought - between two social systems.

The President said that not competition in the arms race and demonstration of military force in international politics, not politics "on the brink of war," but peaceful coexistence and competition between two systems would help the world avoid total war, which "makes no sense in an age when great powers can maintain large and relatively invulnerable nuclear forces and refuse to surrender without resort to those forces." "War makes no sense," J.F. Kennedy stated, "when one nuclear bomb has almost ten times the explosive force of all the allied air forces in World War II."

Unfortunately, only a few months passed after this important statement by President J.F. Kennedy, and he was gone. I return to the thoughts expressed in this,
