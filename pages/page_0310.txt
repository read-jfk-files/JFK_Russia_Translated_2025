Marina Nikolaevna Prussakova, born 1941.
In June 1962, they returned to USA. In March 1963, Prussakova petitioned for return with her daughter to the USSR for permanent residence.
KU MID USSR (letter No. KU-USA-540058-24518 dated October 7, 1963) reported that her petition was declined.
The consular section of the embassy has correspondence with Prussakova and Lee Oswald regarding her return to the USSR. The last letter from Lee Oswald was dated November 9 (text transmitted through close neighbors).
It is possible that American authorities may contact us with a request to review our existing correspondence.
The fact of such correspondence's existence is known to US authorities, as it was sent via official mail.
Given that there is nothing compromising in the correspondence, apparently, in extreme case, we could agree to this (showing our internal correspondence with MID).
I request instructions on this matter.
Radio and television, which have ceased all other broadcasts and are only transmitting messages related to the president's assassination, are now increasingly referring to the fact that the killer was apparently connected "with extreme left elements".
