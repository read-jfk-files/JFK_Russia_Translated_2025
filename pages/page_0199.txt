Russell justifies his request by claiming that he has important information regarding the circumstances of Kennedy's assassination, obtained from unofficial sources. Russell intends to publish this information after he receives additional materials, particularly the Soviet dossier on Lee Oswald (telegram from London 1217).

Since the fact of providing Russell with Soviet dossier materials on Oswald may become known in the USA and cause an undesirable reaction from the American government, the USSR Ministry of Foreign Affairs and KGB under the USSR Council of Ministers consider it inadvisable to satisfy B. Russell's request.

Draft Resolution is attached.

Please review.
