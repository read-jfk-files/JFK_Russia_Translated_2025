[Signal Copy]

The fact of such correspondence is known to US authorities since it was conducted through official mail.

Considering that there is nothing compromising in the correspondence, apparently, in extreme case, we could agree to this (withdrawing our internal correspondence with MFA).

I request instructions on this matter.

Radio and television, which have stopped all other broadcasts and are only transmitting messages related to the president's assassination, increasingly refer to the fact that the killer was apparently connected "with extreme left elements."

Cipher telegram from USSR Ambassador to USA A.F. Dobrynin to USSR MFA regarding possible condolences to US leadership in connection with J.F. Kennedy's death

In connection with Kennedy's death, would consider appropriate:

1. Send condolences from N.S. Khrushchev and L.I. Brezhnev to new president L. Johnson and Kennedy's wife, and from A.A. Gromyko to Rusk.

2. Have someone from government members, for example, A.A. Gromyko visit Kohler and express condolences.

3. Possibly send someone to USA for D. Kennedy's funeral, however this matter can be decided somewhat later when funeral procedure becomes clear, about which we will inform additionally.

Personally, I have sent condolences to the president's wife, Rusk and R. Kennedy.
