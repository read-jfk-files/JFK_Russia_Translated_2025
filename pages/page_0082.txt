I will preserve the memory of personal meetings with President J.F. Kennedy as a figure of broad views, who realistically assessed the situation and sought to find solutions to international problems currently dividing the world through negotiations.

The Soviet government and Soviet people share the grief of the American people regarding this great loss and express hope that the search for solutions to disputed issues, to which President J.F. Kennedy made his considerable contribution, will continue in the interests of peace, for the benefit of all humanity.

Please accept, Mr. President, my personal condolences.
