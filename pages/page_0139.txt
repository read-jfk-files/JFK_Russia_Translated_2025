No. ÐŸ126/48                                                                                                                    November 28, 1963

1. Consider inexpedient the trip to Minsk of the New York Times correspondent Tanner, as well as other foreign correspondents to gather information about L. Oswald's stay there.

2. In case of repeated inquiry from the Moscow correspondent of the New York Times, instruct the USSR MFA to communicate that the facts concerning L. Oswald's temporary stay in the Soviet Union and departure from the USSR are known to the US government, and therefore there is no need to travel to Minsk to gather information about Oswald.
