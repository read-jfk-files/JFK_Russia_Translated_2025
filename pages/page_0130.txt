SOVAMBASSADOR
665160. Agree with you that you should visit the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs (minister or his deputy) and, referring to press reports, inform that Oswald approached the consular department of the USSR Embassy in Mexico requesting a visa to enter the USSR and that the consular department explained to him the procedure for obtaining entry visas and that he has not contacted the USSR Embassy since then. According to Embassy information, Oswald's request for entry of himself and his family to the USSR, which he submitted to the USSR Embassy in Washington, was rejected.

You may respond in this spirit to relevant inquiries from Mexican and foreign press representatives.
