The funeral procession forms in the following order:
- the President's widow, his brother R. Kennedy and other close relatives;
- President L. Johnson;
- heads of foreign states, governments and government delegations who arrived for the funeral;
- U.S. state, political and public figures, friends of the deceased.

The cortege with the body of the deceased, accompanied by military escort and funeral procession (on foot), will proceed from the White House along Pennsylvania Avenue, 17th Street, Connecticut Avenue and Rhode Island Avenue to St. Matthew's Cathedral.

Heads of foreign states, governments and government delegations who do not wish to participate in the funeral procession may proceed directly to St. Matthew's Cathedral with members of their delegations and take their designated places.

Other delegation members should proceed directly to the cathedral and take their seats no later than 11:45.

Heads of embassies and missions meet at the State Department at 10:30 (entrance through the main entrance), from where they proceed to the cathedral. Due to limited parking space, the State Department suggests that heads of embassies and missions, if possible, share vehicles with their colleagues to follow to the cathedral and thus reduce the number of vehicles.

Admission to St. Matthew's Cathedral will be by invitation cards and passes only. Members of foreign delegations can obtain passes at corresponding regional departments of the State Department. Passes for heads of embassies and missions will be handed to them at the main entrance to the State Department at 10:30.
